  AssertNotEqual 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', line
  " ^ line has been changed, but the last character of the 'real' line is
  "   unchanged => <space>0x removed some character before the 'real' end of the
